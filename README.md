# SampleBlogVanillaJS
This sample blog SPA is written in Vanilla JS and uses Express + Bootstrap 5 alpha.

It relies on a [JSON server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) running on port 9001.

The application can be started by `npm run serve` and will run on http://localhost:5060 by default.
